0
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,840
You're glowing

1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,600
You colour and fracture
the light

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,320
You can't help but shine

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,920
And I know that

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,720
You carry the world
on your back

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,280
But look at you tonight

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,280
The lights

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,520
Your face

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,800
Your eyes

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Exploding

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
Like fireworks

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,600
In the sky

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,480
Sapphire

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,880
Touching on your body while
you're pushing on me

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,280
Don't you end the party, I
could do this all week

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,520
We'll be dancing
till the morning

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
Go to bed, we won't sleep

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
They sparkle just like stars

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,760
Sapphire

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,040
Touching on your body while
you're pushing on me

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,320
Don't you end the party, I
could do this all week

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,640
We'll be dancing
till the morning

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,040
Go to bed, we won't sleep

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,360
They sparkle just like stars

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Look what we found

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,240
Karma reached out

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,800
Into our hearts and pulled
us to our feet now

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,040
You know the truth is

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,520
We could disappear

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,800
Anywhere,
as long as I got you there

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,320
When the sun dies

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,640
Till the day shines

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,840
When I'm with you

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,880
There's not enough time

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,320
You are my spring flower

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
Watching you bloom, wow

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
We are surrounded
but I can only see

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,880
The lights

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,000
Your face

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,280
Your eyes

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,600
Exploding

41
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,240
Like fireworks

42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,080
In the sky

43
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,040
Sapphire

44
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,440
Touching on your body while
you're pushing on me

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,800
Don't you end the party, I
could do this all week

46
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,000
We'll be dancing
till the morning

47
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,440
Go to bed, we won't sleep

48
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,440
They sparkle just like stars

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,400
Sapphire

50
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Touching on your body while
you're pushing on me

51
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,880
Don't you end the party, I
could do this all week

52
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,080
We'll be dancing
till the morning

53
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
Go to bed, we won't sleep

54
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,560
They sparkle just like stars

55
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,760
Sapphire

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
(They sparkle, sparkle)

57
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,200
You're glowing

58
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,040
You're glowing

59
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,440
You colour and fracture
the light

60
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Look at you

61
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,680
Tonight

62
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,400
Sapphire

63
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,960
When you
raise your eyelashes

64
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,920
Darkness disappears

65
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
With rainbows wrapped
around your fingers

66
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,160
You move like magic

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,880
How did God embed sapphires
in those eyes?

68
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,880
They sparkle
just like little stars

69
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,560
Sapphire

70
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,000
Touching on your body while
you're pushing on me

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,320
Don't you end the party, I
could do this all week

72
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
We'll be dancing
till the morning

73
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
Go to bed, we won't sleep

74
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,000
They sparkle just like stars

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,720
Sapphire

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
Touching on your body while
you're pushing on me

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Don't you end the party, I
could do this all week

78
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,640
We'll be dancing
till the morning

79
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,120
Go to bed, we won't sleep

80
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,000
They sparkle just like stars

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,840
Sapphire

82
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,080
Touching on your body while
you're pushing on me

83
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,160
(Your eyes)

84
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,440
(Exploding)

85
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,120
(Like fireworks)

86
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,960
(In the sky)

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,840
Sapphire

88
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,840
The lights

89
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Your face

90
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
Your eyes

91
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Exploding

92
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Like fireworks

93
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
In the sky
